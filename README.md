# jstris

A Tetris clone built using JavaScript web components

# Getting Started

If you already have nodeJS > 16 and yarn installed, you should just be able to run:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:dylanbeattie/jstris.git
cd jstris
yarn
yarn test
```

That'll install the required libraries and run the jstris test suite.



## Prerequisites

Check you have a recent (> 16) version of nodejs:

```
jstris $ node --version
v16.6.2
```

Install yarn:
```
npm install -g yarn
```

JSTris is built using snowpack, which requires nodeJS and a package manager; I'm using yarn2 here.
